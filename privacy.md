### Privacy Policy

We take your privacy very seriously. We thus collect only the absolute minimum amount of information necessary to provide our service:
* We collect your email address when you sign up.
* We use Stripe to process payments. Stripe stores your credit card information, but we do not have access to it. This is governed by their [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).
* We use PayPal to send money to you. This is governed by their [privacy policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full).
* We store the location, price, and other data you provide when you publish a spot. The selfie is only visible to users within a 1 km radius of the spot.
* We store metadata of the transaction when you buy or sell a spot.

Apart from that, no personal data ever leaves your device.

Our Privacy Policy might change from time to time. When we change the policy, we will post the changes on this page.
